\noindent Dear Editors:

We would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled ``A new POD-based Approximate Bayesian computation method to identify parameters for formed AHSS'', which we wish to be considered for publication in ``International Journal of Solids and Structures''. No conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript, and manuscript is approved by all authors for publication. I would like to declare on behalf of my co-authors that the work described was original research that has not been published previously, and not under consideration for publication elsewhere, in whole or in part. All the authors listed have approved the manuscript that is enclosed.

In this work, we firstly designed comprehensive experiments to identify and verify the material properties of DP590 after forming. Then we proposed a flexible and feasible POD based approximate Bayesian computation method to calculate the posteriors of material properties. I hope this paper is suitable for  ``International Journal of Solids and Structures''.

We deeply appreciate your consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving comments from the reviewers. If you have any queries, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me at the address below.

Thank you and best regards.

Yours sincerely,

Yang Zeng
